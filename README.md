# EEG-Alpha-Modulation

## Project Description 
This project is used to test alpha modulation in EEG data collected from three subjects. Data was collected using OPENBCI EEG headset. All analysis was done in MATLAB. When doing an alpha modulation test for EEG it is supposed to be evident that when a subject closes their eyes there is more prominent signal in the alpha frequency band as compared to when the subjects eyes are open.
